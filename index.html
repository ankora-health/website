      <h2 class="page__content__subtitle">
        The Healthcare ecosystem in Africa is disconnected.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Healthcare data is scattered and therefore useless, access to quality healthcare services is a pain and
        healthcare tech (tools and software) are so unintuitive and frustrating to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        This <b>disconnect</b> between <b>people, tools and data</b> in the healthcare ecosystem is a big problem which
        has resulted in...
      </p>
      <ul class="page__content__problems">
        <li>
          <b>Patients</b> wasting hours on repetitive process, trying to find the best providers or re-registering the
          same
          information when switching provider, across locations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Health providers</b> losing revenue on cost of storage or damage, lost lives due to lack of context on
          their
          patient’s medical history, got frustrated using tools that are meant to make work easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Health startups</b> don't have the right platforms or APIs to build innovative and useful products.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medical Research</b> is near impossible in Africa.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>And more...</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All these is why we are building <b>Ankora Health</b>, to bridge the disconnect between <b>people, tools and
          data</b> in the
        healthcare eco-system using technology and AI in a <b>secured, easy to use, and importantly intuitive way.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ankora Health</b> will allow healthcare providers to do more, afford patients ease & quality, and provide
        innovative healthcare products the <b>backbone to thrive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We know, It's a going to be a long ride but we are ready to go the long way.
